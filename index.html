			<strong> About CSO Platform for Reform </strong>
			<br>
			In May 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government came into power in Malaysia with a new mandate for institutional reform. Pusat KOMAS, a civil society organisation, initiated the formation of the CSO Platform for Reform (CSO Platform) to enable Malaysian NGOs to contribute strategic proposals for reform to the Institutional Reform Committee. The CSO Platform was established as a group of like-minded NGOs that were organised into thematic clusters based on their areas of specialisation in reform. The aim was to build better working relationships with the respective ministries and empower CSOs to support the government's efforts toward institutional reform.
